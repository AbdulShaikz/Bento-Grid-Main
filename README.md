## Overview

### The Challenge

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- Experience a responsive grid layout where the two components in the left column on desktop move to the bottom on mobile

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) - for live deployment

### What I Learned

Working on this project allowed me to improve my understanding of CSS Grid and responsive design. A key takeaway was efficiently repositioning grid elements based on screen sizes. Here's an example of CSS Grid placement:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 1rem;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
  .left-column {
    grid-row: 3;
  }
}
```

This snippet showcases how the left column moves to the bottom on smaller screens.

### Continued Development

Going forward, I want to:

- Enhance the interactivity using JavaScript for dynamic behavior
- Experiment with Tailwind CSS to simplify styling further
- Improve accessibility features using ARIA roles and proper semantic tags
